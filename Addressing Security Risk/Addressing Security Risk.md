# Addressing Security Risk

## Creating accounts.

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources. 

* You can use MFA (Multi-factor authenticator) to prompt for an authentication code in every login.
