# Analysis, considerations, security and preparation.

In Week 2 we continued our conversation on preparation through planning and analysis. Our goal here is to continue to stress how important the preparation phases of a migration are before taking any major actions. Additionally, getting a clear picture of your application portfolio becomes 
a bigger part of the conversation because you need to better know how each component, function, and resource is going to migrate, and how they will work together in the new environment. 

## E​lastic Beanstalk
With Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without having to learn about the infrastructure that runs those applications.

## T​he Security Pillar
It is important, while evaluating your portfolio, to evaluate the ability to protect your information, systems, and assets. Security should be a major part of the planning, and should be considered from early in the process all the way through to operational phases of your migrations. Here's more info about the [Security pillar](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.security.en.html).

## A​WS Migration HUB
[AWS Migration Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/migration-hub/faqs/) provides a rich web experience that helps you understand your existing IT assets as well as view and track progress of application migrations. It lets you collect and view data about on-premises resources, group those resources into applications, and track the progress of those applications as you migrate to AWS.
